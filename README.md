# Rust/Nodejs Server Watcher
A small server that can work on both nodejs or rust (whichever one is more suitable) that can listen to different resources on your server (such as CPU, RAM) and notify you through different logging methods (discord only for now) about surpassing configureable limits. It can also notify you on an interval, regardless of the amount of system resources used. <br /> <br />


## Usage  
Each of the servers has their own README.md file which will tell you how to set them up. Make sure to read the `env_setup.md` file to prepare your environmental variables.
